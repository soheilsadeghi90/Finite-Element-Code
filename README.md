# Finite-Element-Code
Static + Dynamic Analysis of MDOF system, with various options of modeling in MATLAB

The course project for Advanced Finite Element Course - Lehigh University - Professor Paolo Bocchini

Two packages can be found in this repository. 
First is the package for static analysis, and the second can analyze dynamic problems, using NEWMARK beta method.
Code can be extended by adding materials and more advanced elements. 
Current version provides Bernoulli, Timoshenko, and analytical beams, as well as truss members.
